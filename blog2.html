    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <h2>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?</h2>
    <p>
        Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more <br>
        <br>
        But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack?<br>
        <br>
        Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software development <br>
        <br>
        Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3) <br>
        <br>
        Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.
    </p>
    <h1>Why was Python developed?</h1>
    <p>Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. Fun! The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue reading below.</p>
    <h1>Features of Python Language</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>1. Python is beginner-friendly.</b></dt>
        <dd>Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone, not a coder. It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. 

            For example, here’s a simple code to print “Hello, world” implemented in C (right) and Python (left). Python needs just one line.</dd>
        <dt><b>2. Python is Easy to Learn</b></dt>
        <dd>Python’s rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. Another thing that makes Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++, you write the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every line and correct if it’s wrong.</dd>
        <dt><b>3. Python is highly versatile</b></dt>
        <dd>Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, and for big and complex tasks such as web development, data analytics, etc. This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. These pre-written codes are called Python libraries and frameworks.</dd>
        <dt><b>4. Python is super flexible</b></dt>
        <dd>Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. You can easily run the Python code you wrote on Windows over Linux or macOS without making any changes. Another exciting feature of Python is that it can run along with other programming languages such as Java (Jython) or C Language (CPython).</dd>
        <h1>Applications of Python Language</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development (Backend)</li>
            <li>Software development</li>
            <li>Data Analytics</li>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Mathematical Analysis</li>
